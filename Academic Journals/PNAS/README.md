> The [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS)](https://www.pnas.org/) allows authors to submit their manuscript formatted in LaTeX to the PNAS Journal. For this, they provide a template which contains the structure and reference style they would like for submissions. The PNAS LaTeX template features a two-column layout and mirrors the layout seen in final publications released by PNAS.

# Additional latex instructions

## Guidelines for Submitting Initial LaTeX Submissions
- Please submit a single compiled main manuscript PDF.
- Supporting Information (SI) may be included at the end of the main manuscript PDF or as a separate SI Appendix PDF.
## Guidelines for Submitting Publication-Ready Files (for Revised or Resubmitted papers and Full Contributed Submissions)
- Please note that your submission will be treated as a single directory by our submission system compiler. All .cls, .sty, .bib, .bst, and .bbl files must be uploaded using the “LaTeX Support File” file type.
- Please avoid nesting and using input commands to prevent compilation errors.
- In addition to using the \includegraphics command within the main manuscript file, please upload each figure source file separately, in high-quality PDF or EPS format, using the “Figure” file type.
- For production purposes, tables must also be uploaded separately using the “Table” file type. Please ensure that each table file contains a preamble, the
\begin{document} command, and the \end{document} command, so they can be compiled as independent files. The tables should also be included within the main manuscript file, to provide a complete compiled PDF.
- Bibliographic information may be included within the main manuscript file, or using Bibtex. Please be sure that all .bib, .bbl, .and .bst files are included in the submission if using Bibtex.
- If it is necessary to recompile a file in the submission to resolve an error, please delete the file and upload it again.
- If the PDF compiled by our submission system for any .tex file is incomplete or inaccurate, you may upload a PDF as a “Related Manuscript File” for our staff to use instead.

## Most formatting inconsistencies or errors will be resolved at the proofs stage if your manuscript is accepted.
